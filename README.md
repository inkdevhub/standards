# Polkadot Smart Contract Proposals (PSPs)

Polkadot Smart Contract Proposals (PSPs) describe standards for **smart contracts** operating on blockchains built with [Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk) and based on its (Contracts Pallet)[https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_contracts/index.html]. Usually these contracts are developed in [ink!](https://use.ink/) programming language which is based on [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

The Polkadot Smart Contract Proposals GitHub is a community-based initiative operating under [Ink!DevHub](https://github.com/inkdevhub) initiative.

> __Disclaimer__: The PSP process is not supposed to be a substitute for the Polkadot Governance process or the [RFCs process](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs).
